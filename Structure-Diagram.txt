Data Flow:
User → Frontend → API Request → Backend → Response → Frontend → User Display

Technology Stack & Rationale:

1. Frontend:
   
   - Next.js (React Framework)
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Benefits:
     - Server-side rendering
     - Optimized performance
     - Built-in routing
     - TypeScript support
2. Backend:
   
   - Express.js
   - Node.js runtime
   - Benefits:
     - Lightweight and flexible
     - Large ecosystem
     - Easy to scale
     - Quick to develop
3. API Integration:
   
   - RESTful API architecture
   - CORS enabled
   - JSON data format
   - Structured endpoints (/api/...)
Scalability Plan:

1. Frontend Scaling:
   
   - Component-based architecture
   - Code splitting
   - Static generation where possible
   - CDN deployment
   - Caching strategies
2. Backend Scaling:
   
   - Horizontal scaling capability
   - Load balancing ready
   - Microservices architecture potential
   - API versioning support
3. Deployment Strategy:
   
   - Frontend: Vercel (optimized for Next.js)
   - Backend: Railway or Heroku
   - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
   - Environment-based configuration
4. Monitoring & Performance:
   
   - API health checks
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error tracking
   - Analytics integration
This structure allows for easy maintenance, scalability, and future feature additions while maintaining good performance and developer experience.
